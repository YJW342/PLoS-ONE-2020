# Files in these folders simulate the entrainment processes of travelers and solve the optimal solution for minimum-time entrainment:

Folder 'Controllable_Sleep' contains codes and files of minimum-time entrainment of the full JFK model with controllable sleep (S+C3 model);

Folder 'Controllable_Sleep_2nd' contains codes and files of minimum-time entrainment of the 2nd-order JFK model with controllable sleep (S+C2 model);

Folder 'Controllable_Sleep_PRC' contains codes and files of minimum-time entrainment of the 1st-order JFK model with controllable sleep (S+C1 model);

Folder 'Feedback_Entrainment' contains codes and files of feedback entrainment of the full JFK model with controllable sleep (see Section 4.1.4);

Folder 'Minimum_time_without_sleep' contains codes and files of minimum-time entrainment of the full JFK model without sleep (see Section 4.1.3);

Folder 'Openloop_Entrainment' contains codes and files of open-loop entrainment of the full JFK model with sleep;

Folder 'Section4_1_2' contains codes and files in Section 4.1.2 in PLoS ONE paper, which apply optimal light of the JFK model without sleep on the JFK model with sleep;

Folder 'Spontaneous_Sleep' contains codes and files of minimum-time entrainment of the full JFK model with spontaneous sleep (S+C3 model).
