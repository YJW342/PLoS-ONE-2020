# Codes and files in this folder generate and plot the periodic solutions of the three two-process models:

'JFK_Sleep_I.slx' is the Simulink file of the full JFK model with Process S;

'JFK_Sleep_u.slx' is the Simulink file of the 2nd-order JFK model with Process S;

'PRC_Sleep_u.slx' is the Simulink file of the 1st-order JFK model with Process S;

'f_Kronauer.mat' contains the phase response curve of the JFK model;

The MATLAB Code 'Periodic_Solution.m' load the Simulink files and plot the Figure 9 in the paper.
