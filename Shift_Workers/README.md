# Files in this folder simulate the entrainment process of the night-shift workers and solve the optimal solution of minimum-time entrainment:

Folder 'Open_loop_ref' simulates the open-loop entrainment process of night-shift workers;

Folder 'Optimal_control_after_shift' solve the optimal light after the night-shift for minimum-time entrainment;

Folder 'Optimal_control_during_shift' solve the optimal light during and after the night-shift for minimum-time entrainment.
